Engagement with Course Content
#################################

How many of the enrolled students are actually keeping up with the work? What
are they doing? Content engagement data helps you monitor how many students are
active in your course and what they are doing.

Content engagement data is updated every week for the period Monday at 00:00
UTC through Sunday at 23:59 UTC.

Gaining Insight into Student Engagement
********************************************

EdX Insights delivers data about student engagement in a chart, a set of
metrics, and a report that you can view or download. Descriptions follow; for
detailed information about the computations, see :ref:`Reference`.

======================================
Weekly Student Engagement Chart
======================================

The markers on this chart represent the number of unique students who interacted with course content. The graph plots three categories of engagement: an overall total for students who completed any type of course activity, and totals for students who clicked play for any course video and for students who submitted an answer for a problem. Each total is for activity completed within a one week period. To see the total count for each activity type for a given week, move your cursor over the chart to display a tip.

Activity is included beginning with the week in which the first page visit took
place. The first page visit is typically by a member of the course staff
shortly after course creation.  This data is also available for review in
tabular format and can be downloaded. See the **Content Engagement Breakdown**
report.

======================================
Active Students Last Week Metric
======================================

The total number of students who, at least once, visited a page in the course
during the last complete one week period.

======================================
Watched a Video Last Week Metric
======================================

The total number of students who played at least one of the course videos
during the last complete one week period.

======================================
Tried a Problem Last Week Metric
======================================
  
The total number of students who submitted an answer for at least one problem
during the last complete one week period (for a specified set of problem
types).

======================================
Content Engagement Breakdown Report
======================================

The weekly breakdown of student engagement with course content is available for
review or download. Columns show each **Date** and its **Total
Enrollment**.

You can download the Content Engagement Breakdown report in comma-separated
value format: click **Download CSV**. The CSV file contains the following
columns:

* any
* attempted_problem
* course_id
* created (shows the date and time of the computation)
* interval_end (shows the ending date of the one-week period)
* interval_start (shows the beginning date of the one-week period)
* played_video

See the :ref:`Reference` chapter for a detailed description of each value.

Analytics in Action: Interpreting Data About Student Engagement 
***************************************************************

Many online courses experience periodic drops in student activity that can be
closely correlated to specific events: problem due dates. Teams can forecast
these changes in engagement, implement strategies to mitigate them, and use 
weekly activity counts to monitor their reach.

.. Instead of comparing weekly student engagement counts to the total course enrollment, many teams define a new baseline for assessing student engagement after the first assignment is due.

.. not sure where to put this ^ 

==================================================
An Immediate Appeal, then Ongoing Encouragement
==================================================

To set expectations and encourage a minimum time commitment, one professor
included a one-minute video message in the very first course component.
Speaking directly to the camera, the professor acknowledged that the material
could be daunting. He then made a very specific request: that students complete
not only the first homework assignment, but the entire first month of the
course, before they made a decision to stop.

The professor followed this initial video with a weekly message to the
students. Although the course has only run once, its completion and
certification rates were higher than average for the subject. In the course
exit survey, students indicated that the video messages had a significant
motivating effect.

.. "When you see your first homework assignment, some of you may feel somewhat intimidated. That's normal... However, it would be the wrong thing to stop the course at this point. At least stay in for one month before you make that tragic decision." - Professor Walter Lewin, September 5, 2013

==========================================
Motivation through Public Recognition
==========================================

Some professors encourage learners to stay involved by publicly recognizing the
contributions that they make to the learning environment.

* In one course, the professor wrote weekly updates. Each week she recognized
  students, by username, for their insightful comments in the course
  discussions.

* Another professor updated the **Course Info** page regularly, giving special
  attention to student questions. He followed each question with the student's
  username and a direct and in-depth answer.

==================================================
Gauging the Effectiveness of Your Investment
==================================================

Some teams develop a student engagement strategy for their courses, planning
the timing and content of messages to students and using a variety of delivery
channels. If social media channels are used, messaging typically is delivered
daily or even more frequently. Bulk email messages are usually sent less
frequently, and have longer content. By comparing the levels of student
engagement week over week, or from run to run, you can make comparisons to
evaluate your strategy.
