Engagement with Course Content
#################################

How many of the enrolled students are actually keeping up with the work? What
are they doing? Content engagement data helps you monitor how many students are
active in your course and what they are doing.

Gaining Insight into Student Engagement
********************************************

EdX Insights delivers data about student engagement with the content of your
course in these ways:

* Chart: **Weekly Student Engagement**

  The markers on this chart represent the number of unique students who
  interacted with course content. The graph plots three categories of
  engagement: an overall total for and students who completed any activity, and
  totals for students who clicked play for any course video and students who
  submitted an answer for a problem. Each total is for activity completed in a
  one week period. To see the total count for each activity type for a given
  week, move your cursor over the chart to display a tip.

  Activity is included beginning with the week in which the first page visit
  took place. The first page visit is typically by a member of the course staff
  shortly after course creation.  This data is also available for review in
  tabular format and can be downloaded. See the **Content Engagement
  Breakdown** report.

* Count: **Active Students Last Week** 
  
  The total number of students who, at least once, visited a page in the
  course during the last complete one week period. 

* Count: **Watched a Video Last Week** 
  
  The total number of students who played at least one of the course videos
  during the last complete one week period.

* Count: **Tried a Problem Last Week** 
  
  The total number of students who submitted an answer for at least one problem
  during the last complete one week period (for a specified set of problem
  types).

* Report: **Content Engagement Breakdown** 

  The weekly breakdown of student engagement with course content is available
  for review or download.

  You can download the Content Engagement Breakdown report in comma-separated
  value format: click **Download CSV**.

See the :ref:`Reference` chapter for a detailed description of each value.

Analytics in Action: Interpreting Data About Student Engagement 
***************************************************************

Many online courses experience periodic drops in student activity that can be
closely correlated to specific events: problem due dates. Teams can forecast
these changes in engagement, implement strategies to mitigate them, and use 
weekly activity counts to monitor their reach.

.. Instead of comparing weekly student engagement counts to the total course enrollment, many teams define a new baseline for assessing student engagement after the first assignment is due.

==================================================
An Immediate Appeal, then Ongoing Encouragement
==================================================

To set expectations and encourage a minimum time commitment, one professor
included a one-minute video message in the very first course component.
Speaking directly to the camera, the professor acknowledged that the material
could be daunting. He then made a very specific request: that students complete
not only the first homework assignment, but the entire first month of the
course, before they made a decision to stop.

The professor followed this initial video with a weekly message to the
students. Although the course has only run once, its completion and
certification rates were higher than average for the subject. In the course
exit survey, students indicated that the video messages had a significant
motivating effect.

.. "When you see your first homework assignment, some of you may feel somewhat intimidated. That's normal... However, it would be the wrong thing to stop the course at this point. At least stay in for one month before you make that tragic decision." - Professor Walter Lewin, September 5, 2013

.. Gauging the Effectiveness of Your Investment

.. Many teams develop a student engagement strategy for their courses, planning the timing and content of messages to students and using a variety of delivery channels. Typically, when social media channels are used, messaging is delivered daily or even more frequently. Bulk email messages are usually sent less frequently, and have longer content. By comparing the levels of student engagement week over week, you can evaluate and compare the results of these efforts.
