Practical Magic: Interpreting Data About Student Engagement 
****************************************************************

============================

============================

One professor included an appeal to students to make a minimum time commitment
in the very first course component. In his video message he addressed students
directly, saying, "When you see your first homework assignment, some of you may
feel somewhat intimidated. That's normal... However, it would be the wrong
thing to stop the course at this point. At least stay in for one month before
you make that tragic decision." - Professor Walter Lewin, September 5, 2013

Most online courses experience periodic drops in student engagement that can be
closely correlated to specific events: problem due dates. Teams can forecast
these changes in engagement, implement strategies to mitigate them, and use the counts for engagement with course content to monitor their reach.

.. Melanie: ok to include so specifically? and, how did the retention rate for the first month compare to that of similar online courses/expectations? is there a way to give some quantifiable result?

============================================
Gauging the Effectiveness of Social Media
============================================

Some teams develop a student engagement strategy for their courses, planning the timing and content of messages to students, and using a variety of delivery channels.    both within the social media, , you would look to see if after you posted something was there any increase in students logging in?
same thing for a course communication email
