The data on the edX Insights dashboard can help you validate the choices that
you have made for a course. It can also help you re-evaluate choices in an
effort to improve your course and the experience of your learners. Putting the
data provided by edX Insights to work involves:

* Understanding the context of your course and what changes over time.

* Evaluating reported data against your expectations.

* Deciding whether action is called for.

* Selecting the action to take, and when.
  
This guide contains chapters that introduce the graphs, metrics, 
and reports that you access in edX Insights.

* :ref:`Enrollment_Activity` 

* :ref:`Enrollment_Geography`

* :ref:`Engagement_Content`

Each of these chapters also contains a section for anecdotal "Analytics in
Action". These sections showcase how data has revealed information about
courses and students, and how course teams have reacted to the information.

The edX Insights dashboard includes a brief description for each reported
value: move your cursor over the "information" icon. The
:ref:`Reference` chapter in this guide dives deeper to provide detailed
descriptions of how edX computes the reported values.

.. @Mark H, how to collect and perhaps even solicit more "Analytics in Action" stories? dedicated email? dirrect to the feedback link in the product?
