The data on the edX Insights dashboard can help you validate choices
that have already been made for a course, or cause you to re-evaluate those
choices. The practical magic of interpreting changes in enrollment involves:

* Evaluating changes against your expectations.

* Understanding the context of the change.

* Deciding whether action is called for.

* Selecting the action to take, and when.
  
This guide contains chapters that introduce the graphs, metrics, statistics,
and reports that you access in edX Insights.

* :ref:`Enrollment_Activity` 

* :ref:`Enrollment_Geography`

* :ref:`Engagement_Content`

Each chapter also contains a section for anecdotal "practical magic". These
sections showcase how data has revealed information about courses and students,
and how course teams have reacted to the information.

On the edX Insights dashboard, each reported value has a brief description that
you access by moving your cursor over the "Information" icon. The
:ref:`Reference` chapter in this guide dives deeper to provide detailed
descriptions of how edX computes reported values.
