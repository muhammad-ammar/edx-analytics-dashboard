The edX Insights dashboard makes information about courses available to course
team members who have the Course Staff or Instructor role. The edX Insights
dashboard provides course teams with data about student background and activity
throughout the course. It can help you validate the choices you made in
designing your course. It can also help you re-evaluate choices in an effort to
improve your course and the experience of your learners.

.. ...data about student activity, background, and performance throughout the course. 

Putting the data provided by edX Insights to work involves:

* Understanding the context of your course and what changes over time.

* Evaluating reported data against your expectations.

* Deciding whether action is called for.

* Selecting the action to take, and when.
  
The edX Insights dashboard includes a brief description for each reported
value: move your cursor over the "information" icon to see it. This guide is
intended to offer more complete information to those who are interested.

* For information about how edX computes the values that are reported on the
  dashboard, the :ref:`Reference` chapter provides additional detail. The `edX
  Research Guide`_ is a reference to the data that edX collects and stores.

* For those who want cues for putting the data provided by edX Insights to
  work, this guide contains chapters that introduce the graphs, metrics, and
  reports that you access in edX Insights.

 * :ref:`Enrollment_Activity` 

 * :ref:`Enrollment_Geography`

 * :ref:`Engagement_Content`

Each of these chapters also contains a section for anecdotal "Analytics in
Action". These sections showcase how data has revealed information about
courses and students, and how course teams have reacted to the information.

Note that all of the Analytics in Action anecdotes featured in this early version of *Using edX Insights* describe data that was collected and
acted upon before the release of edX Insights.

You are invited to share your experiences using edX Insights with members of
other course teams. Contact the edX documentation team at `docs@edx.org`_.

.. Measuring the Effectiveness of Bulk Email
.. ==================================================

.. The first time that Professor Ana Bell ran 6.00.1x for MITx, she noticed that students had a real pain point around homework deadlines. Although reminders were posted in three different parts of the course content, students just didn't convert the published due date and time from UTC to their local time zones. After the first assignment due date for the Fall 2013 run, Professor Bell fielded almost 80 individual discussion posts from students who had experienced some time zone confusion.

.. For the Spring 2014 run of the course, Professor Bell decided to use the bulk email feature on the Instructor Dashboard to send reminders to her students. She sent a message a few hours before every course deadline, and even included a link to a UTC conversion website. After the first assignment, she noticed a significant decrease in the number of discussion posts relating to misunderstood deadlines, down to about 20.

.. Beyond the approximate data that she got from comparing discussion posts, Professor Bell also compared the completion rates for the two runs. From a completion rate of about 6% for the Fall 2013 run of 6.00.1x, the completion rate went up to 7% in Spring 2014. While other variables may have contributed to this increase, Professor Bell believes that the "ongoing heartbeat‚Äù of her weekly messages acted not only to solve the specific problem of missed deadlines, but also as a more general motivator, getting students to keep visiting the course and looking at the material.
