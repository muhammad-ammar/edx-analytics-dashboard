Enrollment Activity

How many students are enrolled in my course? Enrollment activity data helps you
monitor how many people are enrolling in your course and how that number
changes over time. EdX Insights delivers enrollment activity data in these
ways:

* Chart: **Enrollment Activity** 

  Each marker on this chart represents the total number of enrolled course
  participants on a particular date. To see the total enrollment count for each
  day, move your cursor over the chart to display a tip.

* Count: **Current Enrollment**
  
  This metric reports the total number of students who enrolled in the course,
  less any students who unenrolled.

* Delta: **Enrollments This Week** 
  
  This metric reports the difference between the enrollment total at the
  bwginning of the last one week update period and at the end of the update
  period.

* Report: **Enrollment Breakdown** 

  The daily total enrollment count, through the date of the last update, is
  available for review or download.

  To download the Enrollment Breakdown report in a comma-separated value
  file, click **Download CSV**.

Practical Magic: Interpreting Changes in Enrollment
****************************************************

===========================
The Colbert "Bump"
===========================

Enrollment for courses on the edX.org site opens several months before the
course start date. This strategy typically results in gradually increasing
enrollments over time, as site visitors find a course, sign up for it, and tell
their colleagues, friends, and family about it. This strategy also gives teams
the opportunity to watch for larger changes in enrollment, the temporary
"spikes" that can occur after particular events, such as marketing campaigns
for the course or for edX in general.

Such events can be expected or unexpected: teams for all edX courses saw
enrollments jump in the summer of 2013, after edX CEO Anant Agarwal was
interviewed on the July 24 edition of *The Colbert Report*, a satirical late-
night comedy show hosted by Stephen Colbert. 

.. what is the actionable insight for this story? It's so great, I'd like to use it, but is there a way to make it showcase a decision or change? Maybe use it to lead in to "the students you have aren't necessarily reflective of the students you *could* have"? (courtesy of John Hess)

===========================
Latecomers Welcome
===========================

After their course started, a team expected that enrollment would level off and
then begin a gradual decline. While they did see an overall decrease in
enrollment, they also noted that even several weeks into the course, occasional
small spikes in enrollment continued to occur. To give the recently-enrolled
students time to catch up, the team decided to adjust the course so that is was
more self-paced: they shifted due dates in unreleased units to be later and
extended the course end date to keep course content open longer.
