Enrollment Activity

How many students are enrolled in my course? Enrollment activity data helps you
monitor how many people are enrolling in your course and how that number
changes over time. EdX Insights delivers enrollment activity data in these
ways:

* Graph: **Enrollment Activity** 

  Each bar represents the enrollment total for each day. Move your cursor over
  the graph to see a popup with the daily counts.

* Count: **Current Enrollment**

* Delta: **Enrollments This Week** 

* Report: **Enrollment Breakdown** 

  To download the Enrollment Breakdown report in a comma-separated value
  file, click **Download CSV**.

See the :ref:`Reference` chapter for a detailed description of each value.

Practical Magic: Interpreting Changes in Enrollment
****************************************************

===========================
The Colbert "Bump"
===========================

Enrollment for courses on the edX.org site opens several months before the
course start date. This strategy typically results in gradually increasing
enrollments over time, as site visitors find a course, sign up for it, and tell
their colleagues, friends, and family about it. This strategy also gives teams
the opportunity to watch for changes in enrollment, temporary "spikes", after
particular events, such as marketing campaigns for the course or for edX in
general. Such events can be expected or unexpected: teams for all edX
courses saw enrollments jump in July 2013 in the week after edX CEO Anant Agarwal was interviewed on a nationally broadcast talk show.

.. what is the actionable insight for this story? It's so great, I'd like to use it, but is there a way to make it showcase a decision or change?

===========================
Latecomers Welcome
===========================

After their course started, a team predicted that the enrollment for their
course would level off or begin a gradual decline. Instead, they continued to
see occasional small spikes in enrollment for several weeks after the start
date. To give recently-enrolled students time to catch up, the team decided to
adjust the course so that is was more self-paced: they made the due dates in
unreleased units later and extended the course end date to keep course content
open longer.
